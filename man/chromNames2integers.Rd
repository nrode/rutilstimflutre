\title{Rename chromosomes}
\usage{
chromNames2integers(
  x,
  basic = FALSE,
  prefix = "chr",
  toreplace2 = "_random",
  prefix2 = NULL,
  thresh.max.chr.int = +Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of chromosome names (if factor, will be converted to character)}

\item{basic}{if TRUE, the unique chromosome identifiers will be sorted alphanumerically (which requires gtools), and will be renamed as 1, ..., nb of chromosomes (for SNPRelate)}

\item{prefix}{characters to be removed at the start of each chromosome name (case will be ignored)}

\item{toreplace2}{second set of characters to be removed in chromosome names (start or end), especially useful for "random" chromosomes (case will be ignored)}

\item{prefix2}{second prefix to be removed at the start of each chromosome name for those for which "prefix" didn't work (case will be ignored)}

\item{thresh.max.chr.int}{threshold on the maximum chromosome integer, above which the renaming will simply be the sequence from 1 to the number of chromosomes}
}
\value{
data frame with the same length as \code{x}, and two columns named "original" and "renamed"
}
\description{
Rename chromosomes into integers, especially useful with FImpute, GEMMA, qqman, SNPRelate, etc.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{## example from grapevine
chroms <- c("chr1", "chr1_random", "chr10", "chr10_random", "chrUn", "chr2")
chromNames2integers(x=chroms)

## example from apple
chroms <- c("Chr15", "Chr01", "Chr02", "Chr00", "Chr02")
chromNames2integers(x=chroms)

## example from cherry
chroms <- c("Super-Scaffold_14", "Super-Scaffold_4374", "Super-Scaffold_27")
chromNames2integers(x=chroms, prefix="Super-Scaffold_",
                    thresh.max.chr.int=500)

## example from apricot
chroms <- c("Pp08", "scaffold_51", "Pp02", "Pp01", "scaffold_23")
chromNames2integers(x=chroms, prefix="Pp", toreplace2=NULL,
                    prefix2="scaffold_")
}
