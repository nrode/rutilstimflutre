\title{Filter for segregation}
\usage{
filterSegreg(
  x,
  thresh.pval = 0.05,
  return.counts = FALSE,
  is.F2 = FALSE,
  nb.cores = 1,
  verbose = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame similar to the output from \code{\link{genoClasses2JoinMap}}, with locus in rows and where the first columns corresponding to parents are discarded, i.e. the first column should be named "seg" and the following should correspond to offsprings}

\item{thresh.pval}{significance threshold at which to control the FWER (Bonferroni-adjusted p values) and the FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p values); the number of non-rejected null hypotheses will be shown only if \code{verbose} is non-zero}

\item{return.counts}{if TRUE, counts used to calculate the chi2 statistic are returned}

\item{is.F2}{if TRUE, it is assumed that the two outbred parents were crossed once to make a F1 which was then autofecundated multiple times to make the offsprings; note that the SNP genotypes of the F1 should not be given (and they are often unavailable)}

\item{nb.cores}{the number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously (not on Windows)}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level (0/1)}
}
\value{
data.frame with one row per locus and several columns (chi2, p value, Bonferroni-adjusted p value, Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p value), as well as counts (if \code{return.counts=TRUE})
}
\description{
Filter genotypes based on the chi2 statistic to test for segregation distortion.
