\usage{
pruneSnpsLd(
  X = NULL,
  snp.coords = NULL,
  gds = NULL,
  ld.threshold = 0.2,
  remove.monosnp = TRUE,
  maf = NaN,
  missing.rate = NaN,

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{matrix of bi-allelic SNP genotypes encoded, for each SNP, in number of copies of its second allele, i.e. as allele doses in [0,2], with genotypes in rows and SNPs in columns; the "second" allele is arbitrary, it can correspond to the minor (least frequent) or the major (most frequent) allele; will be transformed into a "gds" object (see next argument); if some values were imputed, they will be automatically thresholded using \code{\link{convertImputedTo012}} (required by the SNPRelate function)}

\item{snp.coords}{data frame which row names are SNP identifiers, the first column should contain chromosomes as integers (otherwise \code{\link{chromNames2integers}} will be used), and the second column should contain positions; compulsory if the X argument is specified}

\item{gds}{object of class "SNPGDSFileClass" from the SNPRelate package}

\item{ld.threshold}{the LD threshold below which SNPs are discarded; will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{remove.monosnp}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{maf}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{missing.rate}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{method}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{slide.max.bp}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{slide.max.n}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{seed}{seed for the pseudo-random number generator}

\item{nb.cores}{will be passed to "snpgdsLDpruning"}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level (0/1)}
}
\value{
vector of SNP identifiers
}
