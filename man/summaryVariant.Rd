\arguments{
\item{vcf.file}{path to the VCF file (if the bgzip index doesn't exist in the same directory, it will be created)}

\item{genome}{genome identifier (e.g. "VITVI_12x2")}

\item{yieldSize}{number of records to yield each time the file is read from (see ?TabixFile) if seq.id is NULL}

\item{dict.file}{path to the SAM dict file (see \url{https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#CreateSequenceDictionary}) if seq.id is specified with no start/end}

\item{seq.id}{sequence identifier to work on (e.g. "chr2")}

\item{seq.start}{start of the sequence to work on}

\item{seq.end}{end of the sequence to work on}

\item{fields}{genotype field(s) of the VCF to parse (\code{"DP"}/\code{"GQ"}/\code{c("DP","GQ")})}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level (0/1)}
}
\value{
list of matrices (one per field) with one row per variant and 9 columns (n, na, mean, sd, min, q1, med, q3, max)
}
\description{
Compute the mean, sd, min, Q1, med, mean, Q3, max of the genotype qualities per variant, also reporting the number of samples and the number of missing data.
