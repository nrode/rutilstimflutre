\arguments{
\item{glob.form}{character containing the formula for the global model}

\item{dat}{data frame with all the columns required by \code{glob.form}; if the response contains an inline function (e.g., log or sqrt), the untransformed response may still be required}

\item{part.comp.sel}{part(s) of the model (fixed and/or random); if only "fixed", the lm/lme4 and MuMIn packages will be used, otherwise the lmerTest package will be used}

\item{alpha.fixed}{for lmerTest, threshold on p values of fixed effects below which they are kept}

\item{alpha.random}{for lmerTest, threshold on p values of random effects below which they are kept}

\item{ctl}{if NULL, will be the output of \code{lmerControl} with default arguments}

\item{saved.file}{name of the file in which to save all model fits or from which to load all model fits (for MuMIn); for lmerTest, only the fit of the global model will be saved}

\item{nb.cores}{number of cores; ignored with lmerTest}

\item{cl}{an object of class "cluster"; if NULL, will be created automaticall based on \code{nb.cores}; ignored with lmerTest}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level (0/1)}

\description{
For a plant field trial, fit by maximum likelihood (ML) a global linear (mixed) model with all the specified terms, then fit by ML various sub-models and compare them (AICc) or test each term (F-test for fixed effects and likelihood ratio test for random variables), finally select the best model and, if there are random variables, re-fit it using restricted maximum likelihood (ReML).
